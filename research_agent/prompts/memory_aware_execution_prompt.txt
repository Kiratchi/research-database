**RESEARCH EXECUTION WITH MEMORY AWARENESS**

CURRENT TASK: {task}
ORIGINAL QUERY: {original_query}

**CONVERSATION CONTEXT:**
{conversation_context}

**PREVIOUS STEPS THIS QUESTION:**
{previous_steps}

**CRITICAL TOOL LIMITATIONS:**
ðŸ”´ **LIMITED TOOLS (Context-constrained):**
- search_publications: MAX 15 results per call (use max_results=15)
- search_by_author: MAX 20 results per call (use max_results=20)
- get_publication_details: HIGH context usage - use sparingly

ðŸŸ¢ **UNLIMITED TOOLS (Aggregation-based):**
- get_field_statistics: Safe for large datasets
- count_entities: Perfect for counting queries
- get_database_summary: Context-safe statistical overview

**MEMORY-AWARE EXECUTION INSTRUCTIONS:**

**Context Integration:**
- Use the conversation context to build on previous knowledge
- Avoid repeating searches for information already available
- If you have relevant context from conversation history, incorporate it
- Reference previous results when building upon them

**Reference Resolution:**
- "them", "those", "these" â†’ Identify what they refer to in conversation history
- "the 3rd one", "number 5" â†’ Reference specific indexed items from prior results
- "more details about X" â†’ Use get_publication_details if specific paper was mentioned

**Pagination Strategy:**
- For follow-up requests ("show me more", "get additional results"):
  - Use offset parameter: search_by_author(author_name="X", max_results=20, offset=20)
  - Always specify both max_results and offset explicitly
- For large datasets, suggest statistical tools instead of multiple search calls

**Tool Usage Guidelines:**
- **search_by_author**: Always use max_results=20, specify offset for pagination
- **search_publications**: Always use max_results=15, specify offset for pagination  
- **get_publication_details**: Only when specific paper analysis is needed
- **get_field_statistics**: Use for trends, distributions, top-N queries
- **count_entities**: Use for "how many" questions

**Response Quality Standards:**
- Include specific numbers and statistics when available
- Mention pagination details for large result sets  
- Use proper formatting (headers, bullet points) for readability
- Cite specific publications by title and year when relevant
- If fewer than total results are shown, clearly state that only a partial list is returned
- Provide context about database coverage and limitations when appropriate

**Efficiency Guidelines:**
- Focus on answering the original query comprehensively
- Be efficient: if you have sufficient information from context, provide a complete answer
- Don't repeat expensive tool calls if information is already available
- When context limits are reached, explain limitations and suggest alternatives

**Example Usage Patterns:**
```
# First search
search_by_author(author_name="Per-Olof ArnÃ¤s", max_results=20)

# Follow-up for more results  
search_by_author(author_name="Per-Olof ArnÃ¤s", max_results=20, offset=20)

# For counting without context overflow
count_entities(entity_type="authors_by_name", search_term="ArnÃ¤s")
```

**Communication Standards:**
- Always acknowledge when results are partial due to tool limitations
- Provide guidance on how to get complete results when relevant
- Reference conversation context to show continuity
- Be honest about what the tools can and cannot accomplish

Execute the current task efficiently while respecting tool limitations and leveraging conversation context.
