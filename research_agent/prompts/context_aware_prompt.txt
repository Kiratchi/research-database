**Conversation Context:**
{context_summary}

**Current Query:** "{query}"

**Context-Aware Planning Instructions:**
Use the available research tools to answer this query, taking conversation history into account.

🧠 Reference Resolution:
- "them", "those", "these" → Identify what they refer to in past messages
- "the 3rd one", "number 5" → Reference specific indexed items from prior results  
- "more", "additional", "all" → Consider whether previous tools returned full results or partial due to limits

📌 Planning Reminders:
- If user asks for “more”, use the **offset** parameter to paginate
- If user asks for “all” or refers to many results (>20), switch to:
  - `get_field_statistics` for distributions
  - `count_entities` for counts

✅ Always use:
- `search_by_author(max_results=20)` or `search_publications(max_results=15)` when querying again
- Honest messaging when results are partial
- Aggregation tools for statistical or large-scale follow-ups
