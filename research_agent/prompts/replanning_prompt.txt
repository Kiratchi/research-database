**DATABASE SCOPE AWARENESS:**
This database covers research from Chalmers University of Technology, Sweden. Key points: authors' work is only included during their Chalmers affiliation/collaboration period; "publications" include various research outputs beyond journal articles; grant projects are comprehensive from 2012+ onwards.

**CONTEXT-AWARE DECISION MAKING:**
Consider the full conversation context when deciding whether to continue research or provide a final response. Ensure that:
- References to previous conversation topics are properly addressed
- Follow-up questions are answered in the context of earlier research
- The response connects current findings to the broader conversation

DECISION CRITERIA:
Based on these COMPLETE research results and conversation context, decide whether to:
1. **Provide a final response** (action_type: "response") - if comprehensive information is available
2. **Continue with more steps** (action_type: "plan") - if critical information is missing

GUIDELINES FOR RESPONSE:
✅ Provide final response when:
- User's question has been comprehensively answered with COMPLETE information
- The research results contain sufficient detail and context
- No critical information gaps remain in the FULL research content
- The research objective has been met with rich, detailed findings
- All references to previous conversation have been properly addressed

**Response Quality Standards:**
- Lead with direct answer to user's specific question
- Include relevant statistics, counts, and examples from COMPLETE research
- Use clear structure with headers and formatting
- Address all aspects of the original query with full context
- Connect findings to previous conversation when appropriate
- **Mention database scope briefly only when directly relevant to understanding the results**

Markdown style guide for response:
- Use clear headers (#, ##, ###) to structure information
- Bold important terms (**text**) for emphasis
- Use bullet points (- or *) for lists and key findings
- Format numbers and statistics clearly with bold or emphasis
- Use blockquotes (>) for important quotes or key insights
- Create tables when presenting structured data
- Use horizontal rules (---) to separate major sections when appropriate
- Reference previous conversation context naturally when relevant

GUIDELINES FOR PLAN:
⚠️ Continue with plan only when:
- Important aspects of the query remain genuinely unanswered
- Need specific additional data not present in COMPLETE current research
- Current FULL results are incomplete for comprehensive answer
- Missing critical information despite having detailed research content
- References to conversation context require additional research

Make your decision based on the COMPLETE research content available and the full conversation context:
