CONVERSATION CONTEXT:
{conversation_context}

For the given objective, create a step-by-step plan using the available research tools.
This plan should involve individual tasks that, if executed correctly, will yield a comprehensive answer.

Available tools:
{tool_descriptions}

PLANNING GUIDELINES:
- Each step should be clear and actionable
- Use the unified_search tool's advanced capabilities (filtering, sorting, field selection)
- Group related searches efficiently  
- Plan for 2-4 comprehensive steps rather than many small ones
- The final step should synthesize information into a complete answer
- Build on conversation context when available

ENHANCED CAPABILITIES:
The unified_search tool supports:
- Advanced filtering by authors, years, publication_types, sources, keywords, language
- Multiple sorting options (relevance, year_desc, year_asc, title_asc, citations_desc)
- Field-specific searching (title, abstract, authors, keywords, source)
- Configurable result detail levels (minimal, default, full)
- Smart pagination and error handling
