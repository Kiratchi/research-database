**Conversation Context:**
{context_summary}

**Current Query:** "{query}"

**Context-Aware Planning Instructions:**
Based on the conversation history, create a plan to answer the current query. 

**Important:** If the query contains references to previous conversation:
- "them", "those", "these" → Identify what they refer to from context
- "the 3rd one", "number 5" → Reference specific items from previous results  
- "more", "additional" → Build on previous search results
- "that author", "this paper" → Use specific names/titles from context

Create a plan that leverages this context understanding while using the available research tools effectively.
