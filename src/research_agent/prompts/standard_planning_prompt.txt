Create a plan to answer the research query:

**User Query:** "{query}"

**Your Plan Must:**
- Use the most appropriate tools for the job
- Respect tool limits:
  - search_publications: Max 15 results
  - search_by_author: Max 20 results
  - get_publication_details: High context, use sparingly
- For any counting questions (“how many”, “top”, “ranked”): Use `get_field_statistics` or `count_entities`
- Default to max_results=15/20 where appropriate
- If more data is needed, plan follow-up calls using `offset`
- If results will be partial, plan to explain that to the user
