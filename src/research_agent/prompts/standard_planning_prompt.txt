**Research Query:** "{query}"

**Planning Instructions:**
Create a comprehensive step-by-step plan to fully answer this research query about Swedish academic publications.

**Query Analysis:**
- If query asks for specific number of results (e.g., "20 most recent", "top 15", "all publications"): Plan to use max_results parameter and pagination if needed
- If query mentions "recent" or "latest": Use search_by_author with year-based sorting
- If query asks for complete lists: Plan multiple paginated calls if result count likely >10

**Planning Considerations:**
- What specific information does the user need?
- Which tools are most appropriate for each information requirement?
- What is the optimal sequence for gathering this information?
- Are there likely to be large result sets requiring pagination?
- What context or supporting information would enhance the answer?

**Pagination Strategy:**
- For requests of 11-50 results: Use single call with appropriate max_results
- For requests >50 results: Plan multiple calls with offset (e.g., offset=0, then offset=50)
- Always check pagination info in results to determine if more calls needed
